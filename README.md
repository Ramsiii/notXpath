# notXpath
for saving examples of exclusions in Xpath with not, !=, etc.

The goal of this repository is to give examples of Xpath that can be used to exclude elements within HTML docs. 
(Applicable to XML documents as well? - I do not work with XML. I cannot confirm 100% accuracy.)

Documentation on the not function.
"The not function evaluates a boolean expression and returns the opposite value."

You can use the not function to negate many different conditions, including an axis.
